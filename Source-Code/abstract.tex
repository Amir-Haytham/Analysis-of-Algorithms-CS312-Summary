In this work, I am going to exaplain some of our algorithm course and some of our tutrials codes. Also, i describe the algorithms in detailed and at the end there is a project explaining the object who wants to find the shortest path using BFS algorithm. I show different test cases for some algorithms, to make much more doable.
